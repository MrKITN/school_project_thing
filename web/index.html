				<h1>Religious satire in Huckleberry Finn:</h1>
				<h2>How does it relate to the use of religion in modern society?</h2>
			</div>
			
			<p>Since the beginning of recorded history human beings have been searching for answers to life's problems. 
			Religion has been, for a majority of our existance, humanity's greatest response to it's issues. 
			For almost as long as religion has been used to answer our question, it has also been used as an excuse. 
			People have relied on religion as a justification of their actions, stating that their decisions are for 
			a greater puurpose or that the end justifies the means. Leaders have led wars that murdered millions, 
			disputes between people over beliefs have led to the mistreatment and dehumanization of entire groups of people, 
			radicals have terrorized thousands, and many more horrifying events have been caused by people using religion 
			to validate their decisions.</p>
			<p>Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain, masterfully satirizes much of the hypocricy 
			in religion in <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>. In his bildungsroman novel Huckleberry Finn is faced 
			with many hardships and many situations that confuse the innocent boy. His untainted outlook and unbiased 
			mind allow Twain to illustrate many of the conflicting ideals thrust upon Huck by the society attempting to 
			subjugate him.</p>
